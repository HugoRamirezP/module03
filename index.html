               <strong>The bald eagle</strong> <em>(Haliaeetus leucocephalus)</em> is a 
               bird of prey found in North America. A sea eagle, 
               it has two known subspecies and forms a species 
               pair with the white-tailed eagle <em>(Haliaeetus albicilla)</em>,
                which occupies the same niche as the bald eagle 
                in the Palearctic. Its range includes most of 
                Canada and Alaska, all of the contiguous United States,
                and northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of 
                open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth 
                trees for nesting.

            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    The plumage of an adult bald eagle is evenly dark brown 
                    with a white head and tail. The tail is moderately long 
                    and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical 
                    in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism is evident in 
                    the species, in that females are 25% larger than males. 
                    The beak, feet and irises are bright yellow. The legs are 
                    feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. 
                    The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital 
                    areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. 
                    The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere.
                    The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. 
                    The closely related African fish eagle <em>(Haliaeetus vocifer)</em>
                    (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body
                    (albeit of somewhat more rufous hue), white head and tail, but 
                    differs from the bald eagle in having a white chest 
                    and black tip to the bill.
                </p>
            <h2>Range</h2>
                <p>
                    The bald eagle's natural range covers most of North America,
                     including most of Canada, all of the continental United States, 
                     and northern Mexico. It is the only sea eagle endemic to North America. 
                     Occupying varied habitats from the bayous of Louisiana to the Sonoran 
                     Desert and the eastern deciduous forests of Quebec and New England, 
                     northern birds are migratory, while southern birds are resident, 
                     remaining on their breeding territory all year. At minimum population, 
                     in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to Alaska, the Aleutian Islands, 
                     northern and eastern Canada, and Florida.
                </p>
            <h2>Habitat</h2>
                <p>
                    The bald eagle occurs during its breeding season in virtually 
                    any kind of American wetland habitat such as seacoasts, rivers, 
                    large lakes or marshes or other large bodies of open water 
                    with an abundance of fish. Studies have shown a preference for 
                    bodies of water with a circumference greater than 11 km (7 mi), 
                    and lakes with an area greater than 10 km2 (4 sq mi) are 
                    optimal for breeding bald eagles.
